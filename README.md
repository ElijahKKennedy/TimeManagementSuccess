# TimeManagementSuccess
High school students often struggle with managing their time effectively, especially when balancing academic work, extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, and social lives. 
Despite using calendars and to-do lists, many students find it difficult to prioritize tasks, set realistic goals, and keep track of deadlines. 
As a result, students may miss assignments, experience stress, and struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance. 
Current time management tools tend to be too generalized or not tailored to the needs of students, who have unique schedules and priorities. 
If this problem is not addressed, students may experience burnout, lower academic performance, and a negative impact on their overall well-being.
